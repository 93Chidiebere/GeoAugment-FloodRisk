## **GeoAugment**; Geospatial data label generation library for GeoAI modelling.

## Description
Most flood-risk models fail not because of algorithms, but because high-quality labeled flood data is scarce. Many regions, especially in developing countries, do not have consistent historical flood records to support planning and early-warning systems.

GeoAugment addresses this gap at the data level; rather than forecasting floods, it generates realistic flood-risk maps using terrain characteristics such as elevation, slope, and natural water flow. The result is a continuous flood-risk surface, showing where flooding is more or less likely across a landscape.
