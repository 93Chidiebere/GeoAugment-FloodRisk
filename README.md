## **GeoAugment**; Geospatial data label generation library for GeoAI modelling.

## Description
Most flood-risk models fail not because of algorithms, but because high-quality labeled flood data is scarce. Many regions, especially in developing countries, do not have consistent historical flood records to support planning and early-warning systems.

GeoAugment addresses this gap at the data level; rather than forecasting floods, it generates realistic flood-risk maps using terrain characteristics such as elevation, slope, and natural water flow. The result is a continuous flood-risk surface, showing where flooding is more or less likely across a landscape.

## **Flood Risk** Data
This notebook shows step by step guide for generating flood risk synthetic data for further feeding into machine learning or deep learning models, using GeoAugment library.

This library helps geospatial scientists, GIS experts, environmental risk modellers etc., especially when working on environmental projects in Nigeria or Africa as a whole.
